## About

`ClashApp` is a visual fork of `Koala Clash`, adapted to the Bitumi ecosystem but built around the idea of being easy to fully customize for everyone's needs.
In terms of functionality, the app stays compatible with the original idea of Koala Clash, but the interface, branding, and usage scenarios have been simplified for everyday users, for general convenience and aesthetics.

## Differences from the upstream repository

- A compact interface with flexible customization by default;
- Removed the confirmation dialog when importing a subscription via Deep Link;
- Simplified the update-check mechanism: updates come directly from the fork's releases;
- The visuals and user flow have been simplified for general use.

## Installation

For Windows:
- `ClashApp_x64-setup.exe` - regular installer
- `ClashApp_x64-portable.7z` - portable version

### Option 1. Installer

1. Download `ClashApp_x64-setup.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/kirisame-meguru/clashapp/releases) page;
2. Run the installer and complete the installation;
3. After installation, the app will appear in the Start menu as `ClashApp`.

### Option 2. Portable

1. Download `ClashApp_x64-portable.7z`.
2. Extract the archive into any folder.
3. Run `ClashApp.exe`.

### If Windows shows a warning

The build may trigger a `SmartScreen` warning because the app is not signed with a paid code-signing certificate.
This is typical behavior for small open-source Electron projects and does not by itself mean the app contains a virus.

If the file was downloaded from this repository's official releases page, you can click `More info` -> `Run anyway`.

## Deeplink for importing a subscription

The fork supports direct subscription import via the scheme:

```text
clashapp://install-config?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fconnect%2Ftoken&name=ClashApp
```

Where:
- `url` - the url-encoded subscription link (use `encodeURIComponent('...')` in any browser's DevTools)
- `name` - an optional profile name

## Subscription response headers

When a `remote` profile is fetched or updated, the app inspects the HTTP **response headers** returned by the subscription server and uses them to fill in profile metadata. This lets a subscription server drive the profile's name, logo, update interval, theme, and more.

Headers are matched **case-insensitively by suffix** (the app checks `header.toLowerCase().endsWith(name)`), so any vendor prefix is accepted — `profile-title`, `X-Profile-Title`, and `Anything-Profile-Title` are all treated the same. The canonical names are listed below.

| Header | Type | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `profile-title` | string | Sets the profile display name. A `base64:`-prefixed value is base64-decoded as UTF-8. |
| `content-disposition` | string | Fallback for the name when `profile-title` is absent and the name is still the default `Remote File`; the `filename=` / `filename*=''` value is parsed. |
| `profile-web-page-url` | string | Sets the profile's home / dashboard URL. |
| `profile-update-interval` | number (hours) | Auto-update interval, in hours. Stored internally as minutes (value × 60); when present, the interval is locked against manual edits. |
| `subscription-userinfo` | string | Traffic stats in the form `upload=…; download=…; total=…; expire=…` (bytes, plus a unix-seconds expiry). Drives the usage / expiry panel. |
| `profile-logo` | string (URL) | Logo image URL. The image is downloaded (through the profile's proxy when enabled) and embedded as a base64 data URI; falls back to the raw URL if the download fails. |
| `support-url` | string (URL) | Stored as the profile's support link, and used in the HWID-limit error message (see below). |
| `global-mode` | boolean | Enables Global outbound mode for the profile. Any value other than `false` (case-insensitive) enables it; `false` disables it. |
| `x-clashapp-global-mode-warn` | boolean | Show the warning icon next to the Global slider for this profile. Enabled only when the value is exactly `true` (case-insensitive); off by default. |
| `announce` | string | Announcement text shown for the profile. Supports a `base64:` prefix; literal `\n` sequences are turned into line breaks. |
| `custom-css` | string (URL) | URL of a custom CSS theme. Downloaded (through the profile's proxy when enabled) and applied as the profile's theme. |
| `x-clashapp-unsupported-cfg-warn` | boolean | Opt this profile in to the "changed settings" warning. Enabled only when the value is exactly `true` (case-insensitive); off by default. |
| `x-clashapp-custom-tray-menu` | boolean | Sets the custom-tray-menu preference **once, when the subscription is first added** — `true` enables it, `false` disables it (any other value is ignored). Never re-applied on refresh, so the user's later choice in Settings → Appearance wins. |
| `x-clashapp-show-usage-stats` | boolean | Sets the "Show traffic usage stats" preference **once, when the subscription is first added** — `true` enables it, `false` disables it (any other value is ignored). Never re-applied on refresh, so the user's later choice in Settings wins. |
| `x-hwid-limit` | boolean | When the value is exactly `true`, the response is treated as an HWID device-limit rejection rather than a config (import fails with an HWID-limit message). |
| `x-hwid-max-devices-reached` | boolean | Same as `x-hwid-limit`; either header set to `true` triggers the HWID-limit error. The accompanying `support-url` is shown in that message. |

Notes:
- Boolean headers are compared as plain strings. `global-mode`, `x-clashapp-global-mode-warn`, and `x-clashapp-unsupported-cfg-warn` are lower-cased before comparison, while the two `x-hwid-*` headers require the exact string `true`.

## Development

### Requirements

- `Node.js` 20+
- `pnpm` 10+
- `Git`
- the `corepack` npm package (for Node.js 25+)

I recommend reviewing the contents of `.\build_win.ps1` before running it, since it installs all of the requirements above for you.

### Quick start

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/kirisame-meguru/clashapp.git
cd clashapp
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

### Build

```powershell
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run build:win
# - OR -
.\build_win.ps1
```

### Debugging (VSCode)

* Open the project in VSCode via `File` > `Open Folder` > `path_to_project`;
* The built files will appear in the `dist/` folder;
* ~~The detailed procedure for releasing a new version is described in [docs/release-guide.md](./docs/release-guide.md).~~

## Acknowledgements

This project exists thanks to the work of the authors of the original projects:

- [coolcoala/koala-clash](https://github.com/coolcoala/koala-clash) - the basis of this fork
- [JKmake/koala-clash-guar-styled](https://github.com/coolcoala/koala-clash) - the repository it was originally lifted from, because I liked the design
- [xishang0128/sparkle](https://github.com/xishang0128/sparkle) - the project Koala Clash was originally based on

If you like `ClashApp`, please don't forget about the authors of the original software too.
Without their work, this fork would not exist.
